// @title Hello World

Despite being a web developer for most of my career, I haven't really had a consistent personal site.

There's a mix of a personal site not being terribly interesting to build, and not really having much purpose in the modern era. 
A personal site is extra infrastructure to manage that can usually be outsourced to another platform--GitHub, Wordpress, LinkedIn, Twitter.

So why am I doing it now?

Well, that's a good question. It's mostly giving me an opportunity to explore some new web frameworks (Next.js, Preact) and CICD systems (GitHub, Render, Vercel, Deno Deploy).

I've also started having a bit of a desire to have places to publish investigations and longer form thoughts. In the past, I've done plenty of writeups in GitHub issues, StackOverflow, and internally as Notion Docs, Gists, or presentations at the companies I've worked at.

But it would be nice to have a reason to publish some of that for a wider audience in a consistent way.

I don't know that I'll actually continue making this blog into a full-fledged product, but for now, I am iterating on it.

This post was written in Markdown in a flat file in a repo and rendered as a React component via Next.js & next-mdx-remote.
