I write code. I don&#x27;t have a great story about what kind of developer I am. I tend to focus in two directions: Low-level/hacking, and overall Software Development. I really enjoy new tools like React, TypeScript, and Rust, that bring new patterns to Software Engineers and expand the ways we can express code. But I also enjoy just building or taking apart brutally tricky things in x86, C++, or vanilla JS. I have an armchair degree in AppSec and love to think about it.</p><p><em>I&#x27;m a former competitive gamer</em>. I played Left 4 Dead 2. I played on a number of teams from 2010-2020, inluding the NA tournament champions &quot;Team Royalty&quot; in 2011. I&#x27;ve been heavily involved in the modding scene for L4D, which enables competitive play. I served as admin for many community hubs, and built/hosted some as well. I was a prolific Shoutcaster for the game from 2011-2012 or so, and I&#x27;ve been a streamer in the community.<br/>I have a love/hate relationship with gaming. But it has provided me no end of new experiences and challenges.</p><br/></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/about","query":{},"buildId":"NenLz2o1jHQKpf8zWLBLb","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
